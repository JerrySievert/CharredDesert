# EQ

![EQ Image](images/Eq.png "EQ")


**EQ** is a simple 7 function Equalizer, with `FREQ` and `Q`.  **EQ** is meant
to act either as a band-based equalizer or as part of a chain of equalizers.

**EQ** has one `IN` input, and a single `OUT` output.  `FREQ` allows for the
selection of frequency, `Q` for the width of the band to be equalized; lower `Q`
means a larger band, whereas higher `Q` is a smaller band of frequencies.

The `TYPE` allows you to select which type of frequency filter is being used:

* low pass
* high pass
* band pass
* notch
* low shelf
* high shelf
