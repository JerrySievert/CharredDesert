**K** is a simple and small compressor.

**K** has one `IN` input, and a single `OUT` output.  `THR` or Threshold specifies
the voltage threshold for the compressor to kick in.

`RATIO` specifies the ratio to scale any values above the threshold.

`ATT` or Attack specifies the attack value in milliseconds to allow for the
compression envelope to activate.

`REL` or Release specifies the release value in milliseconds to allow for the
compression envelope to activate.
