# Tsunami

![Tsunami Image](images/Tsunami.png "Tsunami")

**Tsunami** is a wave multiplier.  It takes an input via the `IN` jack and
multiplies eight times using an offset set via the *Shift* parameter and CV.

This offset wave is then added to the mix and the current value of the mix,
from top to bottom, is output in each *OUT* jack.

In addition, the *POLY OUT* output is a poly output with each channel set to the
unmixed, shifted output.
