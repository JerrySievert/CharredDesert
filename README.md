# Charred Desert

Interesting modules for [VCVRack](https://github.com/vcvrack/rack).

The name is an homage to [FrozenWasteland](https://github.com/almosteric/FrozenWasteland),
@almosteric's esoteric module set.

This is a growing work in progress, with only a couple of utility modules currently.
More modules will be added, so if you are interested in following along, either
star the repo, or keep checking back.
