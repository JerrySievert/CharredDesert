# SHIFT

**SHIFT** takes a signal, and shifts it in either a positive or negative direction.
One use for this is to take a waveform oscillator with values between `-5` and `5`,
and turn it into a CV source with values from `0` and `10`.

**SHIFT** has an input marked `IN`, an output marked `OUT`, and the ability to
choose the amount to shift via CV and a knob.  A choice can be made to either
clip the values between `-5` and `5`, or to output the natural value.
