# NOISE

**NOISE** is a simple noise generator, offering _white_ noise and _pink_ noise.

![NOISE](images/noise.png "Noise")

**NOISE** has a single input, `GATE`, which allows noise to be generated.  When
`GATE` accepts a signal at or above `1.7`, it generates the selected noise and
outputs via `OUT`.

Noise can be chosen between _white_ and _pink_.
